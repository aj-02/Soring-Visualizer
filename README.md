# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application offers an interactive showcase of various sorting algorithms, providing a visual representation of their inner workings. Whether you're a student learning about algorithms or a curious enthusiast, this tool allows you to witness sorting algorithms in action.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

## Features

### Color-Coded Representation

Each step of the sorting process is visually represented with different colors:

- **Blue**: Default
- **Yellow**: Elements being compared
- **Red**: Elements identified as incorrect and needing movement
- **Green**: Elements in their correct positions

### Interactive Controls

Customize your visualization experience with three controls:

- **Speed**: Choose from five speed levels to adjust the visualization pace.
- **Data Size**: Modify the size of the dataset for sorting.
- **Generate New Data**: Randomly generate new data for sorting experiments.

### Algorithm Complexity

Gain insights into the time and space complexity of the algorithm being visualized.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring sorting algorithms:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Select an algorithm and adjust visualization settings using the provided controls.
4. Enjoy watching sorting algorithms in action!
